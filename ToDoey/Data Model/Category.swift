     Dynamic is a declaration modifier it basically tells the runtime to use dynamic dispatch over standard

     And this basically allows the property to be monitored for change at runtime
     I.e while the app is running so that mean if the user changes the value of name while the app is running
     then that allows realm to dynamically update those changes in the db.
     but dynamic dispatch is actually something comes from the Objective-C API
     So we must mark dynamic with @Objc to explicit that we are using obj-c at runtime
